          <p>Gemini's objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough for a trip to the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.</p>

            <p>NASA designed the Gemini capsule for this program. On the outside, it looked much like the capsule used for the Mercury missions. It was bigger than the Mercury capsule. It could hold two people instead of one. But each astronaut did not have much room. The Gemini capsule improved on the Mercury spacecraft. Basically, the Mercury spacecraft could change only the way it was facing in its orbit. The Gemini could change what orbit it was in. <br> The Gemini capsule flew on a Titan II rocket. The two-stage Titan II was originally a missile. NASA made changes to the missile so it could carry people. Before the first astronauts flew on it, it launched without a crew so that NASA could test its safety. </p>

          <p>A spacesuit is much more than a set of clothes astronauts wear on spacewalks. A fully equipped spacesuit is really a one-person spacecraft.</p>
          <p>Spacesuits help astronauts in several ways. Spacewalking astronauts face a wide variety of temperatures. In Earth orbit, conditions can be as cold as minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit. In the sunlight, they can be as hot as 250 degrees. A spacesuit protects astronauts from those extreme temperatures.
            Spacesuits also supply astronauts with oxygen to breathe while they are in the vacuum of space. They contain water to drink during spacewalks. They protect astronauts from being injured from impacts of small bits of space dust. Space dust may not sound very dangerous, but when even a tiny object is moving many times faster than a bullet, it can cause injury. Spacesuits also protect astronauts from radiation in space. The suits even have visors to protect astronauts' eyes from the bright sunlight.</p>
          <p>The spacesuit consists of several pieces. The Hard Upper Torso covers the astronaut's chest. The arm assembly covers the arms and connects to the gloves. The helmet and Extravehicular Visor Assembly are designed to protect the astronaut's head while still allowing him or her to see as much as possible. The Lower Torso Assembly covers the astronaut's legs and feet. The flexible parts of the suit are made from several layers of material. The layers perform different functions, from keeping oxygen within the spacesuit to protecting from space dust impacts.
            Underneath the spacesuit, astronauts wear a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment. Tubes are woven into this tight-fitting piece of clothing that covers the entire body except for the head, hands and feet. Water flows through these tubes to keep the astronaut cool during the spacewalk.
            On the back of the spacesuit is a backpack called the Primary Life Support Subsystem. This backpack contains the oxygen that astronauts breathe during a spacewalk. It also removes carbon dioxide that astronauts exhale. The backpack also provides electricity for the suit. A fan moves the oxygen through the spacesuit and life support systems, and a water tank holds the cooling water that flows through the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment.
            Also attached to the back of the suit is a device called the Simplified Aid for Extravehicular Activity Rescue, or SAFER. SAFER has several small thruster jets. If an astronaut became separated from the space station, he or she could use SAFER to fly back. </p>

          <p>Gemini 3 was the first flight of Gemini program. Its main goal was to test the maneuvrability of the new vehicle. In the space,  the crew turned on thrust motors to modify the orbit. It took place on March, 23rd of year 1965. <br> <br>Gemini 4 had 3 objectives : </p>
          <p class="tabulation"> • Realize a long-time flight, the first to be longer than one day for the NASA <br> • Achieve a rendez-vous with the second floor of Titan II, which put the vehicle in orbit <br> • Realize the first spacewalk. </p>
          <p>Some difficulties caused the abandonment of the rendez-vous with the second floor of the rocket, in favor of the spacewalk. <br> That's how the astronaut Edward White became the first man to go out in the space.<br>The spacecraft was launched on June, 3rd of year 1965, and came back on earth without problem, 4 days and 62 orbits later.  <br> <br>Gemini 4 ASTRONAUTS : </p>

          <p>Gemini 5 was an long orbital flight that started on the 21st of July 1965. It was the first time an inhabited spacecraft stayed in orbit for more than a week. The main goal of this missions was to realize this very long space flight, because NASA knew that at least 8 days would be necessary to go to the moon. <br>The second objective was to realize a rendez-vous with a 35kg package named REP (Rendez-vous Evaluation Pod), launched after the taking off the rocket. It was equipped by a radar and a radio signal transmitter in order to be detected.<br>To allow a as long flight as Gemini 5, the spacecraf contained fuel cells. Launch has been perfect except a few oscillations of the rocket, a default that will be deleted in the next missions. Moreover, the dysfunction of fuel cells caused problems during the whole mission. Gemini 5 landed 130km far away the expected place, because NASA took a earth rotation of 360 degrees/24h in account, instead of 360,98 degrees/24h. <br> <br> ASTRONAUTS : </p>

          <p>Initially, Gemini 6 was supposed to be launched in october 1965, with the aim of stowing to the rocket Agena, in order to test meeting procedures between two spacecrafts that would be necessary for Apollo. <br> Agena's launching failure provoked the cancellation of this mission, and the NASA decided then to launch Gemini 6 at the same time as Gemini 7, in December 1965. Two goals were so setted up for the Gemini 6 - Gemini 7 mission : </p>
          <p class="tabulation">• Putting the two spacecrafts in orbit will allow Gemini 7 to play the role of target for Gemini 6, but without stowage, due to missing joinction mecanisms on Gemini 7. However, Gemini 6's radar allowed to detect Gemini 7 in a distance of 400km; <br>• Gemini 7's stay in space will raise to two weeks, in order to measure human's capacity to support weightlessness during a expected necessary time to make a lunar exploration flight. </p>

          <p>For the first time, on March, 16th of year 1966, Gemini 8 connected with another unmanned spacecraft in orbit : Agena rocket. Stowage has been successful, but once the two vehicles were stowed, the set started rotating a lot, what rushed the seperation between Gemini 8 and Agena and the come back on earth. The rotation was so important that the two astronaut became almost unconscious. <br>ASTRONAUTS : </p>

          <p>Given the failure that has been Gemini 8, Gemini 9 was a new try, so the objectives were the same. The mission tested different ways of flying near another spacecraft : the first one was to stow with the rocket, second one consisted in simulating the radar breakdown in order to evaluate the meeting in these conditions, and the third one consisted in simulating procedures to rescue a breakdown spacecraf in low lunar orbit. The mission also included a spacewalk with some manipulations to do in the space, during 2 hours and a half. This part of the mission has not been successful because the astronaut Eugene Cernan met a lot a problems during the spacewalk. <br>ASTRONAUTS : </p>

          <p>Gemini 10 connected with another spacecraft and used its engines to move both vehicles. Indeed, it connected with rocket Agena left from Gemini 8, which has no more electricity, so it was the occasion to test stowage with a passive spacecraft. Moreover, two spacewalks have been made during this mission, one including reparation of a collector of meteorites. This mission was completely successful. <br>ASTRONAUTS : </p>

          <p>Launched on September, 12th of 1966, the Gemini 11 mission flew higher than any NASA mission before. After stowing another time with Agena, Gemini 11 flew to an orbit of 1374 km. A spacewalk was also done, but it was not really successful. Gemini 11 closed successfully the problematic of meeting with another spacecraft, which was an indispensable necessity to realize Apollo Program.<br>ASTRONAUTS : </p>
