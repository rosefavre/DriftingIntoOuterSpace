            The goal of the spacecraft, named <em>Freedom 7</em>, was to realize a <a class="clickableCaption" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight" target="_blank">suborbital flight</a> in 15 minutes of time, going to 187m of altitude. <br>
            Unlike Youri Gagarine, first man to go to space, the flight was not orbital around the eart, but it was a <a class="clickableCaption" href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ballistic-trajectory" target="_blank">ballistic path</a>. A less powerful launcher was necessary. However, it was the first flight for which the spacecraft came back in security on earth, whereas Gagarine had to parachute jump.</p>

            <h3 class="MissionName">Mercury Redstone 4 - Mercury Flight 2</h3>
            <p class="Missionexplanations">On July, 21st of year 1961, a second suborbital flight has been made from the same place as the first one, from the 5th launching complex in Cap Canaveral, in Florida. <br>
            As for the first flight, the goal was to send a man in the space and make him back to earth in security, on board of his spacecraft. <br>
            This time, the capsule <em>Liberty Bell 7</em> reached the altitude of 190 km for a flight lasting 15 min. It has been launched by a Restone-type rocket. <br>
            The capsule landed in the Pacific ocean.<br>
            <em>Liberty Bell 7</em> was evoluated compared to <em>Freedom 7</em> from the first mission. Indeed, Mercury Redstone 4 provided a security system which allowed the astronaut to evacuate very quickly the capsule in case of emergency.<br>
            But this system made an unexpectied problem during the splashdown, because it opened itself. Water came in the capsule quickly, forcing Virgil Grissom to escape as fast as possible. The astronaut has finally been saved, and <em>Liberty Bell 7</em> sank.</p>

            <h3 class="MissionName">Mercury Atlas 6 - Mercury Flight 3</h3>
            <p class="Missionexplanations">For the first time in the american spacecraft, the mission objective was to place a man into Earth orbit, observe his reactions to the space environment and safely return him to Earth to a point where he could be readily found. The Mercury flight plan during the first orbit was to maintain optimum spacecraft attitude for radar tracking and communication checks.<br>
            The launch took place on February, 20th of year 1962, with a Atlas-type rocket, from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 14.<br>
            During the flight only two major problems were encountered: </p>
            <p class="tabulation">1. A yaw attitude control jet apparently clogged at the end of the first orbit, forcing the astronaut to abandon the automatic control system for the manual-electrical fly-by-wire system; <br>2. A faulty switch in the heat shield circuit indicated that the clamp holding the shield had been prematurely released - a signal later found to be false. During reentry, however, the retropack was not jettisoned but retained as a safety measure to hold the heat shield in place in the event it had loosened.</p>
            <p class="Missionexplanations">The mission was successful. The first American in orbit. Total time weightless was 4 hours, 48 minutes, 27 seconds.</p>

It confirmed the Mercury's spacecraft durability.<br>A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark. The mission lasted in total 9 hours and 13 minutes, with an orbit rotation of 88 minutes and a highest altitude of 285km. </p>

            <p class="Missionexplanations">In order to finish Mercury Program and validate human's capacity to stay in orbit around earth, NASA started, on May, 15th of 1963, the last Mercury mission. The astronaut Gordon Cooper, on board of <em>Faith 7</em>, completed 22 Earth orbits in 34 hours and 19 minutes, flying at 265km maximum altitude. <br>Gordon knew some technical problems during this flight : On the 19th orbit, the first sign of trouble appeared when the spacecraft 0.05 g (0.5 m/s²) light came on. However, this turned out to be a faulty indicator, and the spacecraft was not reentering. On the 20th orbit, Cooper lost all attitude readings. The 21st orbit saw a short-circuit occur in the bus bar serving the 250 volt main inverter. This left the automatic stabilization and control system without electric power. <br> This mission marks the last time an American was launched alone to conduct an entirely solo orbital mission. </p>

            <p class="safety">Before astronauts flew in Project Mercury, NASA conducted several test flights. These launches did not have people aboard. The test flights helped NASA find and fix problems.
              The first Atlas rocket launched with a Mercury capsule exploded. The first Mercury-Redstone launch only went about four inches off the ground. From these flights, NASA learned how to fix the rockets and make them safer.
              Three other "astronauts" also helped make sure Mercury was safer. A rhesus monkey, Sam, and two chimpanzees, Ham and Enos, flew in Mercury capsules. Sam and Ham made suborbital flights. Sam flew on a "Little Joe" rocket. Ham flew on a Redstone rocket. Enos launched on an Atlas rocket. He made two orbits around Earth. Since all three primates made it home safely, NASA knew it was safe for astronauts.</p>
